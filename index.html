                        In less technical terms it is a way for multiple people to connect to 
                        each other and exchange data at little to no cost, while remaining
                        private, mesh networks mimic the natural growth of community, creating
                        a web of trust and collaboration.

               <h1 class="ui header">Why Should Fremantle Have A Mesh Network?</h1>
               <p>Fremantle is an extremely diverse city, with a strong natural sense
                   of community, and I fear that is slowly fading. A mesh network allows
                   its users to meet other users with similar interest and coolaborate
                   in new and unique ways without being hindered by unstable internet.
                   <br>
                   The city of Fremantle is even more ideal, as it often has events,
                   and the ability to communicate and coordinate during these events
                   is essential, and can be costly to some (mobile data etc). If a mesh
                   network was utilised in this situation it would reduce cost and allow
                   the network to move with the crowd.
                   <br>
                   The network would also be extremely useful for tourists, allowing them
                   to find locations (networks can give a device a location using signal
                   strength, this is already in use) as well as creating a platform
                   for communication, which stops the need for an international sim, or
                   expensive roaming charges.
                   <br>
                   The most powerful use of the network would be the ability to distribute
                   information in the event of a disaster, the self healing abilities of a
                   mesh allow for large amounts of redundance, in an event of a loss of
                   power nodes can be made lightweight enought to run on solar or batteries.
